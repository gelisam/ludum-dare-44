DESIGN PROPOSAL:

- Goal of the game is to reach maximum life. Compete with friends for fastest time
- Bounty used to purchase improvements
- Bounty replenishes over time, but ...

- Bounty CANNOT BE HIGHER THAN LIFE.  Advanced upgrades require almost a full bar, impossible at beginning

- Maximum life requires advances improvements and best creatures
- Life bar is exponential scale, so basic improvements increase the bar a lot at first, but
  advanced improvements are required later

- Bounty improvements are:
  - Add new branch
  - Add leaves
  - Add flowers (might require leaves on the same tile?)
  - Add berries (might require pollinated flowers on the tile?)
  - Add nuts (might require pollinated flowers and birds nearby?)
  - Upgrade, increases branch size or output and increases life, required to upgrade trunk for more branches
  - Prune.  First click removes leaves, second click removes branch entirely

- COLOR CODING helps user understand the associations:
  - Flowers invite bees (basic)
  - Berries invite birds (intermediate)
  - Nuts invite squirrels (advanced)

- Click any bounty improvement, and hover mouse over tile to see cost, click to apply upgrade
  Maybe applicable tiles highlight to guide the user

- Life panel shows the number of improvements and creatures.  Upgraded tiles count for more
